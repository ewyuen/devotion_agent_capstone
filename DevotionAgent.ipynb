It describes their corrupt character and the judgment that awaits them, drawing parallels to Old Testament examples like the fallen angels, Noah's flood, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It highlights their immoral behavior, arrogance, and empty promises, leading people astray and back into sin.

Daniel interprets the writing: \"Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin,\" meaning that God has numbered Belshazzar's kingdom, weighed him on the scales and found him wanting, and divided his kingdom. That very night, Belshazzar is killed, and Darius the Mede takes over the kingdom.\n",

Unable to interpret it, Belshazzar summons Daniel, who rebukes the king for his arrogance and failure to learn from Nebuchadnezzar's experience. Daniel interprets the writing: \"Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin,\" meaning that God has numbered Belshazzar's kingdom, weighed him on the scales and found him wanting, and divided his kingdom.
